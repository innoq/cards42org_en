name: Der goldene Zauberstab

Wouldn't it be nice to be able to wave the magic wand like Hermione Granger in "Harry Potter" and immediately the glasses  - or in our case software systems - are repaired?

Unfortunately our world is not that simple and we have no magic spell to solve our problems.
Instead, it takes a lot of hard work to restore problematic systems back into order.

But maybe it will help you to reflect if you wave our golden wand. Think,
what your spell would fix if you had the chance. Afterwards, discuss the results in the group. 
And who knows, maybe you'll come up with a magical idea that could solve a problem or two.
